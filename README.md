# illBlazorShop
illegible Blazor Cms . build with blazor wasm and .net 6 using mud blazor components. 
she is a CMS with full customization ability for users, it's just a preview of  main project,
in the next version I gonna build more useful CMS using "bit framework" open source project.
it's gonna be big as wordpress but faster and more easy to use. and super cross platform CMS by using "bit framework".
if you have some idea for next version. I will be glad to hear it.
